# Designing a Web App System Using Elastic Beanstalk and CloudFront

### Overview

In this lab, you will learn how to build a complete web application on the AWS cloud platform. The lab is practice-oriented, helping you get familiar with various AWS services through hands-on deployment steps.

Specifically, you will be guided to use:

- **Amazon S3**: Store static websites
- **Amazon RDS**: Host SQL databases
- **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploy and scale web applications
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Distribute content and secure access

The goal of this workshop is to help you understand how to deploy a real-world application system in the cloud environment.
